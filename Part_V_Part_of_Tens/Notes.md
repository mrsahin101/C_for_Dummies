# NOTES

- Strings always ends with NULL character. ASCII code 0. Defined in stdio.h header.

- Structures are like package, combaining some variables together into single package.

#### struct syntax:
-   struct sample
    {
        int a;
        char b;
    }

- After we create structure we need to declare something to use it.

- When writing big programs, it is good to break everything in smaller pieces.
