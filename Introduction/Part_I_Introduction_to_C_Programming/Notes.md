# NOTES

- Before C there was B language. C created after that.

- C is mid-level language. It get advantages of High level languages (readability) and also it get speed of low level languages. That's why C is really good language!

- C created in AT&T Bell Labs. By Dennis Ritchie.

#### C Development Cycle :)

1. Come up with an idea for a program.
2. Use an editor to write the source code.
3. Compile the source code and link the program by using the C compiler.
4. Weep bitterly over errors (optional).
5. Run the program and test it.
6. Pull out hair over bugs (optional).
7. Start over (required).

#### Source Code -> Executable:
- 
    1. Source code converted to object file(.obj or .o)
    2. Linker goes a head and link all those object files together to create executable file!
    3. Executable file is what processor can understand and work with!
    4. If any error occur during process compiling stops and user must fix errors first!

- Basicly there are 4 step for C program to work
    1. Write source code and save it
    2. Compile!(convert to object file)
    3. Link all object files with linker!
    4. Run the program!

- Funny phrase of programming : %10 writing code and algorithms, %90 finding errors and debugging :)
