# NOTES

- syntax for declaring int variable is : int var;

- int var = atoi(string); -> atoi function is used to convert string value to integer!

- Addition syntax in C : var = value1 + value2;

- Substraction syntax in C : var = value1 - value2;

- Multiplication syntax in C : var = value1 * value2;

- Division syntax in C : var = value1 / value2;

- When naming variable in C, don't start naming variable name numbers. Also don't use keywords. You can refer to compiler help manual.

- #define directive syntax : -> #define SHORTCUT value  -> define directive also called symbolic constant. Usually writen with all capital letter for not to confuse with normal variables.
