# NOTES

- Functions basically remove redundancy from programs.

## Functions
- Syntax for functions : 
    type name(arguments..)
    {
        statement(s);
    }

- When naming function; their name must start with letter, not a number.  Cant use space between the name. either use underline or write it all together.

- Function names must be descriptive.

- Some compilers may forbid you use function names starting with underline.

- Avoid naming function same as C **keywords**

- main() is reserved for first function(entry point.)
